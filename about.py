API Procedures
1. Make a file which can Make a file.
Description - "build_file.py"
Done!
2. Make a file that writes data to the file you created.
2.2 File size limit - test and write a new file when the file size limit is reached.
3. Read data
4. Test data meanings
5. Compare to objectives
6. Search for relevant data

API Architecture: API Brain Architecture: API Brain Understanding

API Brain Understanding
Bilocation creates conscious. Also, Bilocation creates understanding. API Brain Architecture creates its understanding via mimmicking bilocation - to make redundant variations of itself. A mirror within a mirror is an anology which can be used to describe this, loosely.

Overview
brain parts: brain_1.py + brain_2.py + etc.

brain_1: a file called, brain_1.py
brain_2: a file called, brain_2.py

brain parts, then: brain_1; brain_2; brain_3; etc.



Part 1
brain_1
The brain_[number] parts work together to perform tasks. The aggregate network efforts comprise operations of functions and memory (memory in the form of variables, such as objects, for example, list([])) which afford instant understanding architecture of "thought" (the equivalent of thought, where thought is, instead, performed by a machine or computer) via thing comparisons (to compare things to themselves and other things, to discover their dimensions and other attributes and charactersitics).
brain_1 performs a function calculation. The function is a fundamental brain synthesis of some input.

brain_1 input
Input received initially comes from the brain's perception of nothing. Such as, where nothing = "", which, in this machine is represented as the character 0.



brain_[number].py files
functions
python3 functions perform calculations

data_[number].py files
memory
python3 variables store memory

build_file - creates a file in the API's folder (folder: a computer file system directory); this is a mechanical necessity operation; files which this build-file.py file builds: (1) data_[number].py files; creates a memory file, and/or creates memory files, to store API Brain memory data; this is for the AI to store its memory, so that it can remember things

file_names - memory about contents; where contents describes, briefly, what data files store in great quantities of detailed descriptions as many variables; contents memory is brief descriptions about data memory files; contents is the method by which the API brain searches for data stored in data files

Summary
legend: [File] - file names' prefixes; example, brain - functions; where "brain" is the prefix of files with names, brain_[number].py, such as brain_1.py
brain - functions
data - memory
build_file - creates data files
modify_file - edit data files
file_names - contents memory



Parts of the brain:
1. think; the think; thinking activity: (1) brain
2. storage, not currently recollected: (1) data; (2) file_names

Note - Whereas, build_file and modify_file are not parts of the brain, so much as they are a "this world" necessity to record the brain AI activity to a computer hard drive. Actually, the real world brain actions are metaphysical, where no such build_file or modify_file parts are required to perform record-to-storage actions - rather, real world conscious auto images itself via bilocation; since that method cannot be here replicated, build and modify files actions are used to jimmy rig a mimmic in "this world" (where this world is actually metaphysical recordation playbacks of the real conscious) of what conscious actually does of the "real world" mechanical and opting action events.
